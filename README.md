# Find-Exception-stacktrace-and-count-in-log-files-using-java
I have created a console application that helps to find the exception lines , stack trace and their count in log file folder using java
It ask for the path or folder where the log files are stored in which you need to find the exception details.
It then asks for the exceptionName to find the respective details.
We have implemented cache using maps for better performance.
It also have the capability to handle dynamic files.
